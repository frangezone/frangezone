Hi, I am frange. I graduated from [CUG(Wuhan)](http://www.cug.edu.cn/) with a CS major. I am currently a PM in Duoyi Network.

Daily attention to the Internet, products, commerce, design and other fields.

### Some hobbies
- Digital: Owns fruit powder family bucket, likes all consumer electronics products, and eats while watching digital video.
- Fitness: has six pack abs, enjoy running, and is currently gaining weight (because he is too thin).
- Podcast: To pass the boring time to and from get off work, currently my favorites are `basically harmless` and `fit4life`.
- Games: play mobile games, pc games and console games, like competition, role-playing, simulation management and cooperative games.
- Watching drama: Marvel series of movies, favorite 'Shield', and recently watching a talk show.
- Design: The design is half-hearted, trying to improve the level of aesthetics and design, drawing practice.
- Thinking: Thinking all the time. Use [flomo](https://flomoapp.com/register2/?MTM5MDA) to write down my daily thoughts.

### Self-expectation
I have been exploring and getting to know myself, hoping to establish connections with more like-minded friends. 
In the future, I don't expect to achieve any major achievements, but I want to be able to do what I like and create some value, nothing more.
